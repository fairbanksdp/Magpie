"where did you come from?" -> Most of my parts can be bought at better-stocked hardware stores and assembled by a typical high-school student.

"asdfghjkl;" -> I realize this is a typical marketing question, but I'm supposed to ask it, otherwise they'll use the low-grade oil on me. So, where did you find out about me?

"school" -> I've always assumed that a chat with me has a highly educational potential.

"Not really" -> So imaginary!

"What kind of a response is that?" -> This is confusing. Why bring finding things out into this?

"you should reboot" -> Crach! Bang Bong!

most interesting respones -> second response where it ignored the input
