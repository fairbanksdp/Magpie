hello, let's talk.
My mother and I talked last night -> Tell me more about your family.
I said no! -> Why so negative?
The weather is nice. -> Do you really think so?
Do you know my brother? -> Why so negative?

when a keyword is included in another word it is still counted
the firs example trigers the negative response and the second one triggers the family response
